                        Mom Can We Talk was founded by Stacy Williams host of Shh Just Got Real Podcast. At a young age Stacy was physically abused never telling anyone, it shaped how she conducted herself as a young adult. Her goal is to help other young adults learn to value themselves & speak their truth. Everyone has a story. You can either tell your story at a Mom Can We Talk event or tell your story on Shh Just Got Real Podcast in interview style.
